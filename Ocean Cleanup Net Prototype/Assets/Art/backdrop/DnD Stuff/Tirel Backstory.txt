not gonna right this all epic n shit, just gonna lay it out easily

basically, Tirel was born into a family that had been forced to become pirates to survive, but found out he was both really good at lying and killing, and found it easy to "get along"
with his crewmates, until he killed them and found more. he kept doing this, taking his family along with him, until they were captured and he was forced to flee, leaving them to their
fate. now he wants to become the most wanted man in the world, for not just his ego/pride and to live his life freely, but also to make sure that if his family survived, the rumours
and tales of his exploits would let them know he was still alive. meeting the party would be right after he escaped onto a leaky merchant ship (or any similar ship), killed the crew, and
managed to reach the nearest port before it sank completely, and upon meeting the party, is going to try and "get along" with them until he's strong enough to be feared not just on the
seas, but the land as well.
